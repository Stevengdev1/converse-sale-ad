# Converse Sales Ad

A front-end project that recreates a product card layout similar to an e-commerce product detail page using only HTML and CSS.

This project focuses on layout structure, CSS Grid, positioning, and styling common UI patterns found in online retail websites.

## Purpose

This project was built to:

* Practice building a realistic product card layout
* Improve understanding of CSS Grid for multi-column layouts

* Work with positioning for UI badges (sale label)

* Reinforce styling for buttons, lists, and links

* Build confidence creating structured, readable HTML

## Features

* Product title and image layout
* Price and shipping information
* “Sale” badge using absolute positioning
* Product description and external link
* Color selection indicators
* Product details list
* Full-width “Add to Cart” button
* Hover states for links and buttons

## Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3

## How It Works

The product card is wrapped in a main container and structured using CSS Grid.
* The layout uses three columns:
    * Product image
    * Product information
    * Product details

* The title and button span across all columns using grid column positioning
* The “Sale” badge is positioned absolutely relative to the product container
* Flexbox is used for smaller layout elements like price alignment and color swatches
* Hover effects improve basic interactivity for links and buttons

## Styling Notes

* CSS Grid is used for the main layout structure
* Flexbox is used for alignment within sections
* Absolute positioning is used for the sale label
* Custom colors simulate selectable product options
* Consistent spacing and borders create a clean, structured look
